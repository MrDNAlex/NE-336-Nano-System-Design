Q1
If we do not have the function of the derivative. 
We can use the formal definition of a derivative where f(x+h) - f(x) / h
and we can make sure that the resulting value is not 0, we can make it something very small to avoid division by 0


Q2
If we have 1000 linear equations we should use an iterative method as it would save a lot of computation and time
1000 linear equations would result in a 1000 x 1000 matrix to solve and it will take a few minutes to solve using a CPU
